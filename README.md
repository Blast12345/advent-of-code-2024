I am doing Advent of Code 2024 to brush up on my programming skills as it has been a few months since I've done any meaningful coding. As such, I'm easing back into it with a familiar language: Swift.

I chose to use Swift Playgrounds because it is more lightweight than a full project and it is a good opportunity to familiarize myself with Playgrounds.
